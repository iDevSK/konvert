= TypeConverter

[.fs-6.fw-300]
The type converters are the linchpin of Konvert.

Every mapping between types, e.g. from `String` to `Int`, is implemented by a `TypeConverter`.
Without any `TypeConverter`, Konvert would not even know how to map from `String` to `String`.

Therefore, Konvert link:provided[provides a lot of `TypeConverter`] in the link:../modules[`konvert-converter` module].
You can even simply create your own (little) library with a collection of custom `TypeConverter` and provide them to Konvert during KSP
(TODO: document).

== Startup

During compilation startup, Konvert uses link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_provider_interface[SPI^]
to collect the implementations of `TypeConverter` on the KSP classpath.
Additionally, Konvert has a similar concept to load all previously generated mapping functions and registers them as well as `TypeConverter`
(TODO: document).
